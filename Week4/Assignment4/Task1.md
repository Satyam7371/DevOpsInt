1. Introduction to Containerization and Docker Fundamentals
   
ðŸ”¹ What is Containerization?

Containerization is a method of packaging and running applications and their dependencies in isolated environments called containers. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel and are lightweight and fast to start.

Benefits:

Portability

Consistency across environments

Efficient resource utilization

ðŸ”¹ Docker Overview
Docker is the most popular containerization platform that allows developers to:

Build container images

Run containers

Share containers via Docker Hub

ðŸ”¹ Basic Docker Terminology
Term	Description
Docker Image	A blueprint for containers; includes code, libraries, and dependencies
Docker Container	A running instance of an image
Dockerfile	A text file with instructions to build a Docker image
Docker Hub	A cloud-based repository to store and share Docker images

âœ… Run a Container in Detached Mode
bash
Copy
Edit

âœ… Stop a Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop <container_id>
âœ… Remove a Container
bash

âœ… Build an Image from Dockerfile
bash

ðŸ”¹ Sample Dockerfile
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Use an official base image
